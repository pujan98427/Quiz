# Quiz App

This repository contains a quiz web application built with Vue.js, designed to provide users with an interactive quiz experience. The application presents users with a series of questions and multiple-choice answers, allowing them to select their choices. Upon completion, users can submit their answers to receive a score. The application leverages Vue 3 and Pinia for state management, offering a seamless and responsive user experience. Explore the repository to dive into the code and customize the quiz to suit your needs!

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
